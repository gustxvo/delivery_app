# Delivery App - Dart Week #9

Delivery App that displays the list of available items, allowing you to choose several items and their respective amounts, then add to the cart to make the payment.

## What I've learned

During this week of the event, I, who have experience mainly with developing apps for native Android, got to know a little about this tool in practice.

- Extensions and mixins are Dart features to speed up development;

- Provider used for managing dependencies;

- Bloc and Cubit used for state management;

In addition, several design pattern techniques were applied and I was able to learn a lot from the perspective of an experienced professional explaining his line of reasoning.

## Experiences acquired

Having a Java and Object Oriented background and also experience with Kotlin and its functional features, even Dart being a new language for me, lots of concepts got inherited (pun intended) and ended up coming as second nature, allowing me to focus only on what the framework has to offer.

It was a great experience and I enjoyed a lot.
